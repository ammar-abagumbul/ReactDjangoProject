  6.1 Recent Quiz Tracking: The application should keep a record of the most recent quizzes up to a certain configurable threshold (e.g., last 30 days).
  6.2 Archiving/Deletion: Old quizzes, beyond the configured threshold, should be either archived into a database for future reference or deleted based on user preferences.
7. Source Linking
  7.1 Source Attribution: Users must have the option to link their notes to an original source (e.g., a webpage, video, or document).
  7.2 Source-Based Quizzing: The application should be capable of quizzing users on the sources of their notes, reinforcing the connection between content and its origin.
